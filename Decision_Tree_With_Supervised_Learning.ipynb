        "A decision tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is a flowchart-like tree structure where it predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features(or attributes). The internal node represents a feature(or attribute), the branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome.\n",
